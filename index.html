      <br>
      <ul>

      <p>ESPM didn't had a development team, as I joined back in 2009. I was hired to maintain the backoffice, that consisted of sharepoint and some custom apps developed by contractors.</p>
      <p>I was responsible for gattering requirements from the users to then, send for development on a contractor.</p>
      <p>It changed when we had a change of management. With the new Director, internal development was prefered, and I started building some scripts and little console programs to help solving day to day problems.</p>
      <p>That got bigger and bigger turning into the present day configuration, where many key decisions are made using applications that I developed.</p>
      <p>I've helped shift a mostly Microsoft shop into a "what fits better to solve the problem" shop, and so, we have lots of diverse tech in prodution like Linux, Rails, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch and others.</p>
      <p>I've also brought Git, Scrum, continuous integration and deployment automation.</p>
