      <p>
        I work professionaly with software development since 1997.
      </p>
      <p>Started working on client/server apps on Visual Basic, and got into Web Development, working with the firsts versions of Classic ASP and PHP.</p>
      <p>Graduated on Data Processing Technology on 2003, and have official trainning in Linux, Scrum and Project Management.</p>
      <p>I'm a avid and quick learner, I like to find answers to problems and that lead me into learning a lot of technologies along my career.</p>

      <b><a href="http://www2.espm.br/english" target="_blank">Full Stack Developer - ESPM <small>since Oct 2009</small></a></b>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Analisys, development, implementation and maintenance of applications</li>
        <li>Evaluation and viability study of new technologies</li>
        <li>Linux Management</li>
        <li>Deployment and optimization</li>
        <li>Backups and replication</li>
        <li>Ruby, Rails, Microsoft .NET</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL, Mysql, Microsoft Sql Server</li>
      </ul>
      <p>ESPM didn't had a development team, as I joined back in 2009. I was hired to maintain the backoffice, that consisted of sharepoint and some custom apps developed by contractors.</p>
      <p>I was responsible for gattering requirements from the users to then, send for development on a contractor.</p>
      <p>It changed when we had a change of management. With the new Director, internal development was prefered, and I started building some scripts and little console programs to help solving day to day problems.</p>
      <p>That got bigger and bigger turning into the present day configuration, where many key decisions are made using applications that I developed.</p>
      <p>I've helped shift a mostly Microsoft shop into a "what fits better to solve the problem" shop, and so, we have lots of diverse tech in prodution like Linux, Rails, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch and others.</p>
      <p>I've also brought Git, Scrum, continuous integration and deployment automation.</p>
